        // ensuring valid email formats, and checking password strength.
        // The actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements of the application.
        // For example, it might include methods for validating user input, checking for existing users,
        // and ensuring that user data meets certain criteria before being saved to the database.
        // This could involve using regular expressions for email validation,
        // checking password length and complexity, and ensuring that required fields are not empty.
        // The validation logic can be reused across different parts of the application,
        // ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication.
